# GaÃ«l Gendron's Personal Website

This is the source code for my personal website built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. It showcases my projects and blog posts. It is designed to be simple, clean, and easy to navigate. The website is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. You can find the live version at [https://ggendro.github.io](https://ggendro.github.io). You can use this as a template for your own personal website.

## :warning: Important Note on File Encoding

When creating or editing Markdown files for this Jekyll site (particularly those in `_posts` and `_projects` directories), ensure they are saved with **UTF-8 encoding WITHOUT BOM** (Byte Order Mark). Files with UTF-8 BOM may cause Jekyll to:

- Fail to recognize front matter correctly
- Not process the file at all

If projects are not showing up, or if you see errors related to front matter, this is likely due to BOM being present in the file. Check if your editor is saving files with BOM. To fix this issue in VS Code: Click on encoding in the status bar, then "Save with Encoding" and "UTF-8".
