## Overview
This project focuses on applying deep learning techniques to genome sequence analysis, 
particularly for identifying patterns in DNA methylation that may be associated with various 
diseases.

## Key Features
- Automated identification of methylation patterns using neural networks
- High-throughput data processing pipeline for genomic datasets
- Interactive visualization of results through a web dashboard
- Statistical analysis tools for validating findings

## Technical Details
The system uses TensorFlow for building and training the neural network models, with 
Biopython handling the genomic data preprocessing. The frontend visualization is built 
with D3.js to provide interactive exploration of complex genomic patterns.
