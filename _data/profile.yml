# Bio Information
short_bio: |-
  I work on AI safety and robustness, focusing on building trustworthy AI systems able to reason in a reliable way,
  based on factuality and causality. I am particularly interested in creating large reasoning models (LRMs) that can learn cause and effect relationships
  from data and use them to perform strong and auditable reasoning in adversarial environments.
  <br>
  <br>
  I am currently finishing my PhD at the University of Auckland at the intersection of deep learning and causality.
  I showcased my work at top AI conferences and received the University of Auckland Best Student Published Paper in Computer Science award in 2023.
  As part of my work, I conducted the [first evaluation of large language models (LLMs) on abstract reasoning](/projects/abstract-reasoning), highlighting their brittleness and limitations.
  I developed a [novel modular language model architecture based on causal principles](/projects/iclm) for out-of-distribution reasoning, showed that causal models 
  can improve the learning of interpretable, robust and domain-invariant mechanisms, and built the first [end-to-end framework for causal extraction and inference](/projects/counterfactual-inference) with LLM agents.

  I work on building trustworthy AI systems that can reason and understand the world around them. My main interests are on factuality, abstract and causal 
  reasoning, which are crucial for creating robust and reliable deep learning systems in real-world production environments.

# Education
education: >-
  I am finishing my PhD at the University of Auckland under the supervision of Prof. [Michael Witbrock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Witbrock) and Prof. [Gillian Dobbie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gillian_Dobbie). 
  I hold a Dipl. Ing. (eq. Msc. in software engineering) at the National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA) of Rennes and a dual Msc. 
  in computer science and machine learning from the University of Rennes 1. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a software engineer at 
  Alten and Amadeus IT Group as a contractor where I developed C++ software for a key component of Amadeus's Global Distribution System, 
  enhancing scalability of the retrieval pipeline. I also hold a research assistant position at the University of Auckland, where I lead
  the research and development of neural-causal networks for behaviour discovery in multi-agent systems.

# Research Highlights
research_highlights: >-
  I led the [first project](/projects/abstract-reasoning) to evaluate and point out the brittleness and limitations of LLMs for learning robust representations of abstract concepts.
  I worked on showing that inducing LLMs and feedforward neural networks to behave as causal models can improve the learning of robust and 
  domain-invariant mechanisms, building and fine-tuning a [novel modular language model architecture](/projects/iclm) based on causal principles for out-of-distribution 
  abstract reasoning. I also created a [novel variational auto-encoder](/projects/disentanglement) based on latent space quantization and causal mechanisms.
  I built the [first end-to-end framework](/projects/counterfactual-inference) for causal extraction and inference with large language model agents. I am currently expanding this framework to
  enable LLMs to retrieve causal structures from natural language and harness them for knowledge discovery and reliable reasoning.
  Finally, I led the research and development of an [open-source project](/projects/social-agents) building the first interpretable neural-causal network for behaviour
  discovery in multi-agent systems.

  I also [featured](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/science/about-the-faculty/school-of-computer-science/our-compsci-people/meet-our-compsci-students-and-graduates/gael-gendron.html) in the [University of Auckland InSCight journal](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/assets/science/Our-research/inscight/InSCight_2024.pdf), which highlights the achievements of students and staff in the Faculty of Science, 
  and delivered a talk at the Natural, Artificial and Organizational Intelligence Institute (NAOInstitute) symposium on Creativity and Intelligence.

# Research Schools
research_schools:
  In November 2020, I attended the research school on Contraint Programming, Combinatorial Optimization and Machine learning, jointly organized by 
  the CNRS's Laboratory of Analysis and System Architectures (LAAS-CNRS), the Association for Constraint Programming (ACP), the Operational Research 
  and Artificial Intelligence research groups (GDR RO and GDR IA), and the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute. I learned about the 
  latest advancements in constraint programming for machine learning and finished at the 4th place in the organized hackaton.
  In March 2021, I attended the Reinforcement Learning Virtual School organised by the Artificial and Natural Intelligence Toulouse Institute and in 
  September 2021, I once again attended the CNRS school on AI and Explainability, organised by the Pierre and Marie Curie University.

  I work on building trustworthy AI systems that can reason and understand the world around them. My main interests are on factuality, abstract and causal 
  reasoning, which are crucial for creating robust and reliable deep learning systems.

  I am finishing my PhD at the University of Auckland under the supervision of Prof. Michael Witbrock and Prof. Gillian Dobbie. I hold a Dipl. Ing. (eq. Msc. in softwre engineering) at the National Institute of Applied Sciences (INSA) of Rennes  and a dual Msc. in computer science and machine learning from the University of Rennes 1.

  I led a project that was the first to evaluate and point out the brittleness and limitations of LLMs for learning robust representations of abstract concepts.
  Since then, I have been working on overcoming them to help LLMs learn knowledge that can be reused in new domains. I showed that inducing LLMs and 
  feedforward neural networks to behave as causal models can improve the learning of robust and domain-invariant mechanisms in two separate domains: 
  abstract reasoning and multi-agent natural systems. In a follow-up study, I worked on enabling LLMs to retrieve causal structures from 
  natural language and harness them for knowledge discovery and reliable reasoning in counterfactual environments.
  
  I Built the first end-to-end framework for causal extraction and inference with large language model agents, using Structural Causal Models and 
  teaching from interventions and counterfactuals

  I Built and fine-tuned a novel modular language model architecture based on causal principles for efficient and domain-invariant
  out-of-distribution reasoning

  I led the research and development of an open-source project building the first interpretable neural-causal network for behaviour 
  discovery in multi-agent systems with Pytorch, PyG and Tigramite

  I Created a novel variational auto-encoder based on latent space quantization and causal mechanisms for robust and efficient representation learning
